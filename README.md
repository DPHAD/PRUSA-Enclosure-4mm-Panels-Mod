# PRUSA-Enclosure-4mm-Panels-Mod
Redesigned parts for Prusa V2 LACK enclosure, so they can accept 4mm thick panels (instead of 3mm acrylic)

Acrylic is expensive, but 4mm coroplast (corrugated plastic) is cheap. This remix resizes parts to accept 4mm panels.

# 4mm Instead of 3mm Panels? So What?
3mm acrylic panels are a significant cost. It is cheaper to use coroplast (corrugated plastic) for some (or all!) of the panels of the enclosure. Coroplast also cuts easily and insulates very well. 

The only gotcha is that typical corrugated plastic is 4mm thick. The enclosure parts are designed for 3mm acrylic, so the solution was to remix the necessary parts to accept 4mm panels instead. The panel slots have been resized to 4.15-4.2mm wide while keeping the thickness of each wall constant at the original 2.0mm.

# Which File is What?
[Raw STL export](https://github.com/DPHAD/PRUSA-Enclosure-4mm-Panels-Mod/blob/main/4mm%20Remix%20Parts%20Export.stl) of the parts that have been resized to 4mm slots (i.e. all the parts that the side panels fit into.)

## Suggestions for Using

1) Replace all 3mm acrylic panels (including doors) with 4mm coroplast and make your own windows for visibility as needed…
2) OR keep the 3mm acrylic doors for visibility, and replace the other three side panels with coroplast. (The original 3mm slotted door hinge pieces are still compatible with the 4mm slot remixes.)
This remix contains only the parts from the Prusa Enclosure V2 (MMU2S) that hold the panels. Meaning: if you already own the parts from the V2 enclosure, but want to use 4mm thick coroplast instead of 3mm acrylic, print these parts and replace the originals with them.  

Thankfully the STP format CAD files were released for the original design, making this remix much easier!  I included my own STP file to make further mods easier.

### Final notes and perspective regarding fire risks of using Coroplast:

- It is NOT a bad fire hazard; it can catch fire, but it is more “melt” than “burn". It does not burn the way most plastics do.
- It does not ignite and go up the same way that wood or cardboard does.
- The IKEA LACK is itself made from wood and cardboard (just for perspective)
